# Mosaic_Multiviewer
This guide is how to make your own video only mulitviewer in a 2x2 format leveraging ffmpeg and MediaMTX. ffmpeg takes in 4 rtsp streams, transcodes them to 640x360 in a 2x2 format and then publishes them to MediaMTX which takes the stream and makes it available for viewing in the desired output format. 


See Mosaic_Multiviewer/Guides for easy instructions

See https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx for MediaMTX documentation and software.
